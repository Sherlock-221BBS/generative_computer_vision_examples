# Generative Computer Vision Examples

This respository will contain most famous generative computer vision models, their implementations, and easy walkthroughs via notebook. This will contain model implementation from scratch. The main purpose of the repository is as follows 

- easy walkthrough of the entire process of building complex models, creating dataset, training loop, visualization etc. It aims to contain enough code and example necessary to understand the whole topic.
- will contain links to colab or kaggle notebook so that anyone can open the link and start playing with the code immediately. If you like a notebook, please don't forget to give an upvote 
- Each model will have their own folder and in the folder there will be README.md file giving the necessary details required to understand the model. 

One of the thing that you may ask is why having this repository when some awesome people of the community also has their repository containing most of the examples of this repo. The main reason behind this is that the people who are trying to understand some complex model is that they don't know the resources, some find resources but their is not one notebook link to tell them everything. This repository aim to have enough exhaustive resources as well as clickable notebooks that one can rightly jump in 

## Notes
- I am not the authoritative figure on all the topic discussed here. The code is not unique and it will be most of the time same as the code of the people from whom I have learnt the particular model. 
- The work is in progress. The main intention is to show how to code the main architecture of the model hence some of the times training is not done. It will be updated shortly with good example of dataset trained on that particular model
- Credits always goes to the original teacher from whom I learnt.
- This is an ongoing effort and often will be incomplete but will contain enough code and concepts to understand the core of particular model and task.
